# CausalArima

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CausalArima is to estimate the causal effect of an intervention on a univariate time series using ARIMA models.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of CausalArima from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("CausalArima") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of CausalArima from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FMenchetti/CausalArima")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the package:

```{r example, warning=FALSE }
library(CausalArima)

# simulate data
n<-100
set.seed(1)
x1 <- 100 + arima.sim(model = list(ar = 0.999), n = n)
y <- 1.2 * x1 + rnorm(n)
y[ floor(n*.71):n] <- y[ floor(n*.71):n] + 10
data <- cbind(y, x1)
dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2014-01-05"), by = "days", length.out = n)
start<-as.numeric(strftime(as.Date(dates[1], "%Y-%m-%d"), "%u"))

# Adding a fictional intervention
int.date <- as.Date("2014-03-16")

# fit the model - Causal effect estimation
ce <- CausalArima(y = ts(y, start = start, frequency = 1), dates = dates, int.date = int.date,
                  xreg =x1, nboot = 1000)
```

How to obtain the plot of the forecast:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
forecasted<-plot(ce, type="forecast")
forecasted
```

How to obtain the plot of the estimated effects and cumulative effects:
```{r, fig.height=6}

impact_p<-plot(ce, type="impact")
grid.arrange(impact_p$plot, impact_p$cumulative_plot)
```

How to obtain a quick summary of the estimated effect:

```{r}
summary(ce)
```

How to obtain a detailed summary of the results, with an option to produce tables in html format (notice that to proper display the results as html on a Rmarkdown chunk you have to set result as 'asis'). Other possible format include "numeric", useful to retrieve the statistics and use them in calculations, and "latex". Estimated model:
```{r, results='asis'}
summary_model<-impact(ce, format="html")
summary_model$arima
```

Causal impact:
```{r, results='asis'}
summary_model$impact_norm
```

Causal impact based on boostrap:
```{r, results='asis'}
summary_model$impact_boot
```

How to inspect the residuals, with the plots of autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) functions and QQ-plots:
```{r, fig.height=6}
residuals<-plot(ce, type="residuals")
grid.arrange(residuals$ACF, residuals$PACF, residuals$QQ_plot)
```

## Example with more horizons

```{r}
# simulate data
n<-100
set.seed(1)
x1 <- 100 + arima.sim(model = list(ar = 0.999), n = n)
y <- 1.2 * x1 + rnorm(n)
y[ floor(n*.71):n] <- y[ floor(n*.71):n] + 10
data <- cbind(y, x1)
dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2014-01-05"), by = "days", length.out = n)
start<-as.numeric(strftime(as.Date(dates[1], "%Y-%m-%d"), "%u"))

# Adding a fictional intervention
int.date <- as.Date("2014-03-16")
horizon<-as.Date(c("2014-03-25", "2014-04-05")) # add horizons

# fit the model - Causal effect estimation
ce <- CausalArima(y = ts(y, start = start, frequency = 1), ic = "aicc", dates = dates, int.date = int.date,
                  xreg =x1, nboot = 1000)
```

How to obtain the plot of the estimated effects and cumulative effects:
```{r, fig.height=6}

impact_p<-plot(ce, type="impact", horizon = horizon)
grid.arrange(impact_p$plot, impact_p$cumulative_plot)
```

How to obtain a quick summary of the estimated effect:

```{r}
summary(ce, horizon = horizon)
```

How to obtain a detailed summary of the results, with an option to produce tables in html format (notice that to proper display the results as html on a Rmarkdown chunk you have to set result as 'asis'). Other possible format include "numeric", useful to retrieve the statistics and use them in calculations, and "latex". Estimated model:
```{r, results='asis'}
summary_model<-impact(ce, format="html", horizon = horizon)
summary_model$arima
```

Causal impact:
```{r, results='asis'}
summary_model$impact_norm
```

Causal impact based on boostrap:
```{r, results='asis'}
summary_model$impact_boot
```

## Modify the plots

The plotting functions have some graphical parameters that make easier to personalize the plots:
```{r}
forecasted_2<-plot(ce, type="forecast", fill_colour="orange",
               colours=c("red", "blue"))
forecasted_2
```


All plotting functions return a ggplot object or a list of ggplot objects, which makes easy to modify any ggplot parameters of the theme. The ggthemes package can be useful to employ directly some pre-customized themes, for example we can use the Wall Street Journal theme simply typing:
```{r}
library(ggthemes)
forecasted+theme_wsj()
```
