\usage{
CausalVAR(
  y,
  exogen = NULL,
  dates,
  int.date,
  alpha = 0.05,
  horizon = NULL,
  VAR.args = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Matrix (or data.frame) of observations (missing values are not allowed).}

\item{exogen}{Optional vector, matrix or data.frame of regressors to be included in the model.}

\item{dates}{Vector of dates of length t (with elements of class \code{Date}) corresponding to the
observations in y.}

\item{int.date}{Date of the intervention (must be of class \code{Date}).}

\item{alpha}{Confidence level for the estimated causal effect. Defaults to 0.05, i.e., reporting
a two-sided 95\% confidence interval.}

\item{horizon}{Optional vector with elements of class \code{Date}. If provided the function
computes a causal effect up to each specified date.}

\item{VAR.args}{Additional arguments to be passed to VAR. Optional, if not specified, the
estimation of the model in the pre-intervention period is done using
the default values of \code{VAR} in the \code{vars} package.}

\description{
The function estimates the causal effect of an intervention on a multivariate
time series. It uses vector autoregressive models (VAR) to learn the time
dynamics of the series in the pre-intervention period; then, it performs a prediction
step (using external regressors, if provided) to forecast the series in the absence
of intervention. The comparison between the observed series post-intervention
and the forecasted series gives the causal effect. The function also computes
the cumulative and the temporal average effect up to each time horizon given in
\code{horizon} (if NULL, those effects are estimated up to the end of the analysis period).
